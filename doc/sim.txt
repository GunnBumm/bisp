This is a short overview of the design.

Layers:
- Energy: electricity + diesel
          Modeled as a FNode graph
- Hydro:  grey and clear water
          Modeled as a FNode graph
- Thermo: termperature
          Modeled as a RNode graph
- Light:  solar and artificial
          Modeled as a CNode graph

Layers are connected by CNode graphs.

Node types:
- CNode: Calculation Nodes
         (A calculation DAG)
- FNode: Flow Nodes
         - Energy: fuel or electrons
         - Hydro: water molecules
         - Light: photons
- TNode: Thermal Nodes
         (used for a room adjacency graph which relaxation functionality)
