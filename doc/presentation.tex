  \frametitle{Context}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Climate change is a real problem
    \item We need to lower our carbon footprint in order to limit the damage
    \item Goals have been set for decreasing the use of fossil fuels
    \item Buildings make up a significant part of the consumption so this is a good place to start
    \item The first step in acting is knowing
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Problem}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Testing on a real building has implications
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A bug in the developed logic can bring down the building
        \item People get mad when you bring down the building
      \end{itemize}
    \item Alternative: Use a simulator
    \item Testing on a simulator has implications
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The modeled world is an approximation
        \item Results may not be transferable
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We can't provide access to a building
    \item We can provide access to a simulator
